### Graduate Students

Available graduate opportunities will be posted on the Clemson [Assistantship Openings](https://www.clemson.edu/cafls/plant-environmental-sciences/students/assistantships.html) site. Prospective students should apply through the Clemson Graduate School [Admissions](https://www.clemson.edu/graduate/admissions/apply/new-applicants.html) page. Students are expected to pursue support from intramural or extramural fellowships throughout their graduate tenure.

As a member of our group, graduate students will gain knowledge in phenomics as it applies to plant breeding and genetics. Collaborations across multi-disciplinary research groups will be expected. We provide training through group meetings, individual meetings, and a supportive lab environment.

### Undergraduate Students

We welcome undergraduate students who are committed to research into our lab. We are happy to introduce and train undergraduates in aspects of genetics, phenotyping, and phenomics. If you are an undergraduate interested in discussing research opportunities please [contact Trevor]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact).

### Programmers

Our programming team is responsible for the code that goes into our apps, algorithms, and analytical pipelines. They are expected to maintain high standards of documentation, clarity, efficiency, and maintainability in their own code, and also help the other members of the lab achieve the same in their code. Job postings will be posted [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/news) or [Contact Trevor]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact).

### Postdoctoral Associates

We regularly have research opportunities for postdoctoral scientists who have experience in plant genetics and computer science. Available opportunities will be posted [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/news). To be considered, send [Trevor]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact) a cover letter, curriculum vitae, statement of research interests, and contact information for three references.
